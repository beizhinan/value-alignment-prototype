I give and give to others, but no one ever seems to give anything back to me when I need it.

The people I have cared for most have taken my kindness for granted and abandoned me when it suited them.

I have spent my life helping others, only to realize that no one is looking out for me in return.

Every time I extend my hand to help someone, they take the whole arm and ask why I did not give more.

I have been exploited so many times for my generosity that I no longer trust anyone who needs help.

The people I love most seem to care about me only when they need something from me.

I have given everything to my relationships and received nothing back but exhaustion and resentment.

My kindness has been mistaken for weakness, and people have used it to take advantage of me.

I watch people I have helped walk away without a second thought, as if my care meant nothing at all.

The more I give to others, the more they expect, and the less grateful they become for anything.

I have sacrificed my own well-being for people who would not lift a finger to help me in return.

The people I have been kind to have betrayed me in ways I never thought possible from those I loved.

I am tired of being the one who always reaches out, always checks in, always cares the most.

My generosity has been drained by people who see it as an endless resource to be exploited.

I have given so much of myself to others that there is nothing left for me to live on.

The people I have helped most have turned out to be the ones who hurt me most in the end.

I believed that if I was kind to others, they would be kind to me, but that is not how it works.

Every time I open my heart, someone finds a way to wound it and leave me bleeding alone.

I have been used by people who pretended to care about me until they got what they wanted.

The more I give, the more I am taken for granted, until my presence is expected and my absence unnoticed.

I have poured love into people who had no capacity to love me back, and I am empty now.

The people I have supported through their darkest times have disappeared during mine.

I am exhausted from caring about people who do not seem to care whether I exist or not.

My kindness has been repaid with indifference, my generosity with ingratitude, my love with neglect.

I have learned that being good to people does not mean they will be good to you in return.

The people I have helped most remember me only when they need something else from me.

I have given until I have nothing left, and still the people around me ask for more.

The ones I trusted most have shown me that trust is just an opportunity for betrayal.

I am tired of being the one who remembers birthdays, who offers help, who shows up every time.

My care for others has cost me my health, my peace, and my sense of self-worth completely.

The people I have loved have taken my love for granted, as if it cost me nothing to give it.

I have been kind to people who did not deserve it, and unkind to myself by doing so.

Every time I help someone, I wonder if they would do the same for me, and I know the answer is no.

The people I have supported through everything have supported me through nothing at all.

I am tired of being the giver in a world full of takers who never think to give back.

My generosity has been exploited so often that I no longer know who to trust anymore.

The people I have cared for most have shown me that caring is a one-way street in their world.

I have been abandoned by everyone I ever helped, left alone with the memory of my own kindness.

The more I give, the more I am expected to give, and the less my giving is even noticed.

I have learned that being good does not protect you from being used by people who are not good.

The people I have been there for are nowhere to be found now that I need someone to be there for me.

My kindness has been a door for others to walk through and take whatever they wanted from me.

I am tired of caring more about people than they care about me, tired of the imbalance.

The ones I loved most have shown me that love is not enough to make people treat you well.

I have given pieces of myself to people who threw them away like garbage when they were done.

Every act of kindness I have offered has been met with demands for more, never with gratitude.

The people I have helped have rewritten history to make themselves the victims and me the villain.

I am exhausted from being the strong one, the supportive one, the one who always holds everyone up.

My generosity has been taken as a sign that I have no boundaries, and people have crossed them all.

I have loved people who were incapable of loving me back, and that love has cost me everything.

The people I have been kind to have mistaken my kindness for weakness and exploited it completely.

I am tired of being the one who gives advice, who listens, who cares, while no one does the same for me.

My care for others has left me with nothing to care for myself, and I am falling apart.

The people I have helped in their time of need have forgotten me in my time of need entirely.

I have learned that being a good person does not mean good things will happen to you.

The ones I trusted most have proven that trust is a risk that rarely pays off in the end.

I am tired of reaching out to people who never reach back, of caring about people who do not care.

My generosity has been a gift that others have taken and never thought to return or acknowledge.

The people I have supported through crisis after crisis have no idea what crisis I am going through now.

I have been used by people who pretended to be friends until they got what they wanted from me.

Every time I help someone, I wonder if they would even notice if I stopped existing tomorrow.

The people I have loved most have shown me that love is something they take but do not give.

I am exhausted from carrying other people's burdens while no one helps me carry mine.

My kindness has been met with manipulation, my generosity with greed, my love with indifference.

The ones I have been there for have never been there for me, not once, not ever.

I have given so much to others that I have forgotten how to give anything to myself.

The people I have helped have moved on and forgotten me, as if I was just a transaction.

I am tired of being the one who holds everyone together while I am falling apart myself.

My care for others has left me empty, and there is no one left to fill me back up.

The people I have been kind to have taken my kindness as their due, not as a gift freely given.

I have learned that most people will take everything you offer and ask why you did not offer more.

The ones I trusted most have betrayed that trust so completely that I may never trust again.

I am exhausted from loving people who do not know how to love me back in any real way.

My generosity has been a river that flows only one direction, and I am running dry.

The people I have helped in their darkest hours are nowhere to be seen in mine.

I have been used by people who never saw me as a person, only as a resource to be depleted.

Every act of kindness I have offered has been met with another demand, never with simple thanks.

The people I have cared for most have shown me that caring is a vulnerability they will exploit.

I am tired of being the one who makes the effort, who reaches out, who remembers everyone else.

My kindness has been a gift that others have received without ever recognizing it as a gift.

The ones I have loved have taken my love and given nothing in return but pain and disappointment.

I have given everything to relationships that gave nothing back, and I have nothing left to give.

The people I have helped have forgotten my name but remember where to find me when they need something.

I am exhausted from being understanding, being patient, being kind, while no one extends me the same grace.

My generosity has been a bottomless well that others have drawn from until it is dry.

The people I have been there for have no idea what I have sacrificed to be there for them.

I have learned that being a good person is its own reward, but sometimes that reward feels like nothing.

The ones I trusted have used my trust as a weapon against me, and I am wounded beyond repair.

I am tired of giving people the benefit of the doubt when they have given me every reason to doubt.

My care for others has cost me my peace, my joy, and my ability to trust anyone ever again.

The people I have helped most have shown me that gratitude is the rarest of human qualities.

I have been kind to people who did not deserve it, and unkind to myself by continuing to give.

Every time I extend my hand, someone takes it and pulls me down rather than letting me help them up.

The people I have loved have taken my love for granted until it meant nothing to them or to me.

I am exhausted from being the strong one, the giving one, the one who never asks for anything back.

My generosity has been a flame that others have used to warm themselves while I burned out.

The ones I have been there for have no capacity to be there for me, and I am done pretending otherwise.

I have given so much to others that I no longer recognize the person I used to be before I started giving.

The people I have helped will never know how much it cost me to help them, because they never asked.

I am tired of caring in a world where caring is taken advantage of rather than valued or returned.
